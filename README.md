UTOPIA

Solution : A local community based platform to ensure sustainable living through engaging civilians and executive authorities.


Utopia is a cloud based platform that allows citizens to participate in their community’s responsibilities for their well-being and executive authorities to take effective actions for the betterment of the society. Initially, the platform is planned to be Android based but it is to expand to other platforms. One of the problems that this platform addresses is authentication of news, another problem it addresses is effective communication between authorities and civilians. Additionally, it helps users to understand social taboo on the basis of right information. Utopia utilizes it’s user’s sense of responsibility to collectively identify community issues that need attention. Also the platform helps the authority to make informed decisions. The authority will have their own dashboard to view the most important issues and send platform wide notices. The platform will also monitor and show the actions taken by the authorities and volunteers. While any user can perform volunteer work but the most responsible users can apply for official volunteers of the platform. The official volunteers can directly contribute and quickly respond to issues, also they will receive recognition for their contribution to the platform. Users of this platform will be able to participate in their own area and also give the option to contribute in other areas. In their areas, the users can raise important issues by writing posts and providing photos of the issues. Moreover, the platform will use GPS coordinates and databases to accurately represent an issue. Reported issues can be viewed by other users and executive authorities in the platform and actions can be taken about the issue. Users can report local issues that comprise hazardous road conditions, social safety and spread social awareness. Additionally, notices from respected authorities can be given to the civilians of the locality incase of repairing of electric line, gaspipe, water supply and avoid chaos. Moreover, Utility services, traffic news and volunteer help will be available through the platform. Users will report and the platform will try to eliminate rumour, fake news, spamming,  illegal activities, cultural and religious indignity from society. Users can help each other by posting locations and reviews of medical centers, bus/train timings and provide local guidance. Most importantly emergency situations can be handled in an organized and manageable way. Everyone can actively engage during national emergencies like earthquakes, cyclones, collapsing buildings, floods. To keep the users engaged and provide more utility, the platform will also feature necessary extensions like, local area student services, medical appointments, local employment and second-hand markets. Initially, we will fund the platform through crowd-funding. In our case, equity based crowd-funding can be beneficial, donations can be optional. For the maintenance of the platform and providing returns to the investors, the main source of revenue would be advertising. To conclude, Utopia platform will provide opportunities where the civilian and the authority can make informed decisions and contribute in their local areas in an organized way to create a more effective and functional society.
